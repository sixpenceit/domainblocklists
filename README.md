# domainblocklists
Blocklists for internet filtering from various sources. I will try to cite them as best I can.

I'm attempting to create a massive single-source list of pornography sites that people can use for blocking sites on their personal or home networks. I may also create additional lists for other categories of websites that people may want to block (e.g. gambling, political media, etc.). 

If you would like to submit lists of domains for me to include, please contact me here.
